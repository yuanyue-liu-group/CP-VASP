# CP-VASP
Thank you for taking interest in CP-VASP! CP-VASP is a patch to the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to enable DFT calculations under constant electrode potential. Using CP-VASP, the electron number, energy, and forces can be determined for any structure under a given electrode potential. Thus, CP-VASP enables structural relaxation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation under a fixed electrode potential.

# Installation
Please visit our group's page (https://sites.utexas.edu/yuanyue-liu/codes/cp-vasp/) and fill out the request form. We will subsequently give you access to the patch files.
